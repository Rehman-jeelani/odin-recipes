    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><Strong>Marinate the Chicken:</Strong>In a large bowl, combine chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, coriander powder, salt, lemon juice, mint, and coriander leaves. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or overnight for best flavor).</li>
        <li><Strong>Prepare the Rice:</Strong>Wash and soak basmati rice for 30 minutes. In a large pot, boil 6 cups of water with whole spices (cloves, cardamom, bay leaf, cinnamon) and salt. Add soaked rice and parboil (70% cooked). Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><Strong>Fry Onions:</Strong>In a large pan, heat oil and fry the sliced onions until golden brown. Remove half for layering later.</li>
        <li><strong>The Marinated Chicken:</strong>In the same pan, add the marinated chicken and cook on medium heat until chicken is tender and masala thickens. Do not overcook. If needed, add a splash of water.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer the Biryani:</strong>In a deep pot, layer half the cooked chicken, then half the rice. Sprinkle some fried onions, mint, coriander, saffron milk (optional), and a little ghee. Repeat with remaining chicken and rice. Finish with garnishes.</li>
        <li><strong>Dum (Steam Cook):</strong>Cover the pot with a tight lid (or seal with dough) and cook on very low heat for 20–25 minutes.</li>
        <li><Strong>Serve:</Strong>Gently fluff the biryani and serve hot with raita or salad.</li>
